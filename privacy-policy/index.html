<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority
for the management of the Konstantin Denerz. The use of the Internet pages of the Konstantin Denerz is possible without
any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website,
processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no
statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall
always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data
protection regulations applicable to the Konstantin Denerz. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise
would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and
process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which
they are entitled.</p>
<p>As the controller, the Konstantin Denerz has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the
most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may
in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is
free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
<h2 id="1-definitions">1. Definitions</h2>
<p>The data protection declaration of the Konstantin Denerz is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the
adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and
understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to
first explain the terminology used.</p>
<p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>
<h3 id="a-personal-data">a) Personal data</h3>
<p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An
identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors
specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<h3 id="b-data-subject">b) Data subject</h3>
<p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller
responsible for the processing.</p>
<h3 id="c-processing">c) Processing</h3>
<p>Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data,
whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or
alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
<h3 id="d-restriction-of-processing">d) Restriction of processing</h3>
<p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the
future.</p>
<h3 id="e-profiling">e) Profiling</h3>
<p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate
certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that
natural person&rsquo;s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability,
behaviour, location or movements.</p>
<h3 id="f-pseudonymisation">f) Pseudonymisation</h3>
<p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed
to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept
separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed
to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
<h3 id="g-controller-or-controller-responsible-for-the-processing">g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h3>
<p>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or
other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;
where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the
specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>
<h3 id="h-processor">h) Processor</h3>
<p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf
of the controller.</p>
<h3 id="i-recipient">i) Recipient</h3>
<p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are
disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of
a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of
those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the
purposes of the processing.</p>
<h3 id="j-third-party">j) Third party</h3>
<p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller,
processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal
data.</p>
<h3 id="k-consent">k) Consent</h3>
<p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject&rsquo;s
wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of
personal data relating to him or her.</p>
<h2 id="2-name-and-address-of-the-controller">2. Name and Address of the controller</h2>
<p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in
Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:</p>
<p>Konstantin Denerz</p>
<p>Barbarastr. 45</p>
<p>66265 Heusweiler</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Email: <a href="mailto:konstantin.denerz@gmail.com">konstantin.denerz@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Website: <a href="https://konstantin-denerz.com">https://konstantin-denerz.com</a></p>
<h2 id="3-cookies">3. Cookies</h2>
<p>The Internet pages of the Konstantin Denerz use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via
an Internet browser.</p>
<p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique
identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to
the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to
differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>
<p>Through the use of cookies, the Konstantin Denerz can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services
that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>
<p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow
us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for
users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the
website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user&rsquo;s computer
system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that
a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>
<p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding
setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set
cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular
Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all
functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p>
<h2 id="4-collection-of-general-data-and-information">4. Collection of general data and information</h2>
<p>The website of the Konstantin Denerz collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated
system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1)
the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which
an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to
the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing
system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information
technology systems.</p>
<p>When using these general data and information, the Konstantin Denerz does not draw any conclusions about the data
subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the
content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology
systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Konstantin Denerz analyzes anonymously collected data and
information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to
ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are
stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>
<h2 id="5-subscription-to-our-newsletters">5. Subscription to our newsletters</h2>
<p>On the website of the Konstantin Denerz, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise&rsquo;s newsletter.
The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is
ordered from the controller.</p>
<p>The Konstantin Denerz informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise
offers. The enterprise&rsquo;s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail
address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail
address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in
procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is
authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>
<p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet
service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the
registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail
address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.</p>
<p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In
addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the
newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the
newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data
collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data
subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the
newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each
newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the
controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.</p>
<h2 id="6-newsletter-tracking">6. Newsletter-Tracking</h2>
<p>The newsletter of the Konstantin Denerz contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic
embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a
statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the
Konstantin Denerz may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called
up by data subjects.</p>
<p>Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the
controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters
even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data
subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the
double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. The Konstantin
Denerz automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.</p>
<h2 id="7-contact-possibility-via-the-website">7. Contact possibility via the website</h2>
<p>The website of the Konstantin Denerz contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as
well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail
address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by
the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the
data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this
personal data to third parties.</p>
<h2 id="8-subscription-to-comments-in-the-blog-on-the-website">8. Subscription to comments in the blog on the website</h2>
<p>The comments made in the blog of the Konstantin Denerz may be subscribed to by third parties. In particular, there is
the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a particular blog post.</p>
<p>If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail to check
the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The
option to subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time.</p>
<h2 id="9-routine-erasure-and-blocking-of-personal-data">9. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data</h2>
<p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to
achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or
regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p>
<p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another
competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p>
<h2 id="10-rights-of-the-data-subject">10. Rights of the data subject</h2>
<h3 id="a-right-of-confirmation">a) Right of confirmation</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation
as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself
of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.</p>
<h3 id="b-right-of-access">b) Right of access</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information

<ul>
<li>the purposes of the processing;</li>
<li>the categories of personal data concerned;</li>
<li>the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular

</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a
third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be
informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.</p>
<p>If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of
the controller.</p>
<h3 id="c-right-to-rectification">c) Right to rectification</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue
delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the
processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of
providing a supplementary statement.</p>
<p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of
the controller.</p>
<h3 id="d-right-to-erasure-right-to-be-forgotten">d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of
personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal
data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise
processed.</li>
<li>The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the
GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.</li>
<li>The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding
legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the
GDPR.</li>
<li>The personal data have been unlawfully processed.</li>
<li>The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the
controller is subject.</li>
<li>The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article
8(1) of the GDPR.</li>
</ul>
<p>If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored
by the Konstantin Denerz, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of Konstantin
Denerz shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.</p>
<p>Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data,
the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps,
including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has
requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as
processing is not required. An employees of the Konstantin Denerz will arrange the necessary measures in individual
cases.</p>
<h3 id="e-right-of-restriction-of-processing">e) Right of restriction of processing</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of
processing where one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the
accuracy of the personal data.</li>
<li>The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the
restriction of their use instead.</li>
<li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data
subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
<li>The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the
legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing
of personal data stored by the Konstantin Denerz, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The
employee of the Konstantin Denerz will arrange the restriction of the processing.</p>
<h3 id="f-right-to-data-portability">f) Right to data portability</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him
or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall
have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal
data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR
or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the
processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject
shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically
feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p>In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of the
Konstantin Denerz.</p>
<h3 id="g-right-to-object">g) Right to object</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her
particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e)
or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>
<p>The Konstantin Denerz shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate
compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject,
or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
<p>If the Konstantin Denerz processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to
object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to
the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the Konstantin Denerz to the
processing for direct marketing purposes, the Konstantin Denerz will no longer process the personal data for these
purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to
processing of personal data concerning him or her by the Konstantin Denerz for scientific or historical research
purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the
performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>
<p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the Konstantin Denerz. In
addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding
Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>
<h3 id="h-automated-individual-decision-making-including-profiling">h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely
on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly
significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance
of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to
which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject&rsquo;s rights and
freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject&rsquo;s explicit consent.</p>
<p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a
data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject&rsquo;s explicit consent, the Konstantin Denerz shall implement
suitable measures to safeguard the data subject&rsquo;s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to
obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.</p>
<p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any
time, contact any employee of the Konstantin Denerz.</p>
<h3 id="i-right-to-withdraw-data-protection-consent">i) Right to withdraw data protection consent</h3>
<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing
of his or her personal data at any time.</p>
<p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any
employee of the Konstantin Denerz.</p>
<h2 id="11-data-protection-for-applications-and-the-application-procedures">11. Data protection for applications and the application procedures</h2>
<p>The data controller shall collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of the processing of the
application procedure. The processing may also be carried out electronically. This is the case, in particular, if an
applicant submits corresponding application documents by e-mail or by means of a web form on the website to the
controller. If the data controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the submitted data will be stored
for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with legal requirements. If no employment
contract is concluded with the applicant by the controller, the application documents shall be automatically erased two
months after notification of the refusal decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the controller are
opposed to the erasure. Other legitimate interest in this relation is, e.g. a burden of proof in a procedure under the
General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).</p>
<h2 id="12-data-protection-provisions-about-the-application-and-use-of-twitter">12. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Twitter</h2>
<p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of Twitter. Twitter is a multilingual, publicly-accessible
microblogging service on which users may publish and spread so-called ‘tweets,’ e.g. short messages, which are limited
to 280 characters. These short messages are available for everyone, including those who are not logged on to Twitter.
The tweets are also displayed to so-called followers of the respective user. Followers are other Twitter users who
follow a user&rsquo;s tweets. Furthermore, Twitter allows you to address a wide audience via hashtags, links or retweets.</p>
<p>The operating company of Twitter is Twitter International Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street Dublin 2, D02
AX07, Ireland.</p>
<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which
a Twitter component (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding Twitter component of Twitter. Further
information about the Twitter buttons is available under <a href="https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons">https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons</a>. During the
course of this technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the
data subject. The purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a retransmission of the contents of this
website to allow our users to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our visitor numbers.</p>
<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter detects with every call-up to our website by the
data subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific sub-page of our Internet page
was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Twitter component and associated with the
respective Twitter account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Twitter buttons integrated on
our website, then Twitter assigns this information to the personal Twitter user account of the data subject and stores
the personal data.</p>
<p>Twitter receives information via the Twitter component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the
data subject is logged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the
person clicks on the Twitter component or not. If such a transmission of information to Twitter is not desirable for the
data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Twitter account before a call-up to our website
is made.</p>
<p>The applicable data protection provisions of Twitter may be accessed under <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en">https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en</a>.</p>
<h2 id="13-data-protection-provisions-about-the-application-and-use-of-youtube">13. Data protection provisions about the application and use of YouTube</h2>
<p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of YouTube. YouTube is an Internet video portal that enables
video publishers to set video clips and other users free of charge, which also provides free viewing, review and
commenting on them. YouTube allows you to publish all kinds of videos, so you can access both full movies and TV
broadcasts, as well as music videos, trailers, and videos made by users via the Internet portal.</p>
<p>The operating company of YouTube is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.</p>
<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which
a YouTube component (YouTube video) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding YouTube component. Further information
about YouTube may be obtained under <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/">https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/</a>. During the course of this technical procedure,
YouTube and Google gain knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>
<p>If the data subject is logged in on YouTube, YouTube recognizes with each call-up to a sub-page that contains a YouTube
video, which specific sub-page of our Internet site was visited by the data subject. This information is collected by
YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the data subject.</p>
<p>YouTube and Google will receive information through the YouTube component that the data subject has visited our website,
if the data subject at the time of the call to our website is logged in on YouTube; this occurs regardless of whether
the person clicks on a YouTube video or not. If such a transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not
desirable for the data subject, the delivery may be prevented if the data subject logs off from their own YouTube
account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>
<p>YouTube&rsquo;s data protection provisions, available at <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>, provide information
about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.</p>
<h2 id="14-legal-basis-for-the-processing">14. Legal basis for the processing</h2>
<p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific
processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to
provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing
operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data
is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of
another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age,
health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.
Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing
operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes
of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by
the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such
processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European
legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the
controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>
<h2 id="15-the-legitimate-interests-pursued-by-the-controller-or-by-a-third-party">15. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h2>
<p>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our
business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>
<h2 id="16-period-for-which-the-personal-data-will-be-stored">16. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h2>
<p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for
the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>
<h2 id="17-provision-of-personal-data-as-statutory-or-contractual-requirement-requirement-necessary-to-enter-into-a-contract-obligation-of-the-data-subject-to-provide-the-personal-data-possible-consequences-of-failure-to-provide-such-data">17. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data</h2>
<p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from
contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).</p>
<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must
subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our
company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the
contract with the data subject could not be concluded.</p>
<p>Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies
to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the
conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of
non-provision of the personal data.</p>
<h2 id="18-existence-of-automated-decision-making">18. Existence of automated decision-making</h2>
<p>As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p>
